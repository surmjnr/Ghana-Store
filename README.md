## Overview
Welcome to the E-Group-6 project repository! This is a collaborative space for our end-of-semester project, where we contribute to building a comprehensive web application.

## Features
Our web application includes the following features:
- **Web Pages**: Various HTML files for different sections of the application, such as `about.html`, `account.html`, `cart.html`, and more.
- **Styles**: A `style.css` file that contains the styling rules for our web application.
- **Scripts**: Contains a `package.json` file to manage project dependencies and a `package-lock.json` for locking down the versions.
