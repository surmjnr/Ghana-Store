## Overview
Welcome to the Ghana Store project repository! This repository is part of my personal portfolio and showcases the collaborative development of a web application designed to simulate an e-commerce platform for local products and services.

## Features
The Ghana Store application includes:
- **Web Pages**: A collection of HTML files for different sections, such as `about.html`, `account.html`, `cart.html`, etc.
- **Styles**: A `style.css` file that provides the styling framework for the user interface.
- **Scripts**: A `package.json` file to manage dependencies and a `package-lock.json` for version control.
